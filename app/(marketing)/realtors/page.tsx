/**
 * `/realtors` — Chippi for the solo realtor who's boots-on-the-ground.
 *
 * The story: a realtor flying solo spends the day in the field — at the
 * showing, in the car, between doors. Chippi is the extra teammate who works
 * alongside them, reachable on the phone, the installed web app, or the office
 * desktop. It reads the inbox, drafts in their voice, books the tour, scores
 * the lead, and keeps every deal current — saving time on the repetitive work
 * so the hours go to closing. Everything lands in one workspace instead of six
 * tabs, and the realtor stays in the driver's seat on every send.
 *
 * This page absorbs the content of the now-retired /features/* pages, told in
 * the homepage's rebuilt vocabulary: AsciiBlob hero atmosphere, serif headlines,
 * Reveal/Stagger motion, live product diagrams, and the home kit throughout.
 *
 * Auth-aware like the homepage: signed-in realtors bounce to their workspace.
