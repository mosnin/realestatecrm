/**
 * `/company` — Chippi's founding story. Replaces the old `/about`.
 *
 * One idea: the world moved to AI; real estate didn't — so two people who'd
 * lived the gap built Chippi to close it. The page leads with the mission,
 * makes the problem feel inevitable, lets the founders stand as proof it's
 * built by people who know the work, folds the brand beliefs in as conviction,
 * and closes calmly.
 *
 * Matches the rebuilt homepage aesthetic: AsciiBlob hero atmosphere with a
 * center-protect radial, serif section headlines on the home clamp, the home
 * kit's Reveal / Stagger / Eyebrow motion, light canvas. Brand orange stays a
 * signature (the blob, the serif "Chippi") — never on a button or link.
 *
 * Auth users bounce to their workspace, mirroring the homepage.

            <p>
              An agent’s day is mostly attention management. Email, calendar,
              replies, follow-ups, pipeline updates. The actual selling,
              the listening and judging and knowing, happens in maybe ten
              percent of it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Everywhere else, that other ninety percent has started to run
              itself. In real estate it still doesn’t. The tools are stuck a
              generation behind what’s now possible. Agents and brokerages are
              nowhere near the productivity the moment allows. That distance,
              between what could happen and what actually does, is the whole
              reason Chippi exists.
