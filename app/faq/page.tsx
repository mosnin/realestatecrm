    question: 'What is Chippi?',
    answer:
      'Chippi is a leasing lead workflow built for solo realtors. It helps you capture renter inquiries through a structured intake form, qualify them with AI scoring, and follow up faster from one clear command center.',
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: 'Who is Chippi built for?',
    answer:
      'Chippi is designed for solo agents and small teams handling renter and leasing leads who want a cleaner daily workflow without a bloated CRM setup.',
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: 'How does the intake link work?',
    answer:
      'You get one intake link that you share in your bio, listing replies, or email signature. Renters fill out a guided form with their budget, move-in date, neighborhood preferences, and household details. Every submission becomes a clean lead record in your dashboard instantly.',
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: 'What does AI scoring actually do?',
    answer:
      'AI scoring reviews the submitted context and assigns a priority score to each lead — hot, warm, cold, or unscored. Each score comes with a plain-language summary so you understand why a lead was ranked that way. It\'s assistive, not autopilot.',
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: 'Can I understand why a lead was scored a certain way?',
    answer:
      'Yes. Chippi keeps the supporting context visible on every lead record so prioritization is always understandable and actionable. There are no black box scores.',
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    question: 'How fast can I get set up?',
    answer:
      'Most agents can get their intake link live in minutes and start collecting structured renter data the same day. No configuration or complex onboarding required.',
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    question: 'What happens after a renter submits the intake form?',
    answer:
      'You immediately get a lead record with all the qualification details, an AI priority score, status visibility, and clear next actions for follow-up. The renter receives a confirmation that their inquiry was received.',
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    question: 'Do I need to replace my current CRM?',
    answer:
      'No. Many agents start Chippi as a leasing command center first, then decide what to keep or consolidate. Chippi is focused on leasing leads — it\'s not trying to be a bloated all-in-one tool.',
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    question: 'Does Chippi include a full CRM?',
    answer:
      'Yes. Beyond the intake and scoring workflow, Chippi includes full contact management with activity logs, email history, deal tracking, and follow-up scheduling.',
  },
  {
    id: 10,
    question: 'Can I track deals and pipeline stages?',
    answer:
      'Yes. Chippi has a kanban-style deal pipeline with customizable stages, deal values, close dates, and full activity tracking per deal. You can link deals directly to contact records.',
  },
  {
    id: 11,
    question: 'Is there analytics built in?',
    answer:
      'Yes. The analytics dashboard shows lead volume trends, qualification rates, conversion ratios, pipeline distribution, and average time-to-follow-up — all in one view.',
  },
  {
    id: 12,
    question: 'How much does Chippi cost?',
    answer:
      'Chippi is $97 per month, all features included. There are no tiers, no feature gates, and no usage limits. Every new account starts with a 7-day free trial — no credit card required.',
  },
  {
    id: 13,
    question: 'Is there a free trial?',
    answer:
      'Yes. Every account starts with a 7-day free trial so you can test the full workflow before paying. No credit card required to sign up.',
  },
  {
    id: 14,
    question: 'Can I cancel any time?',
    answer:
      'Yes. You can cancel your subscription at any time from your account settings. No lock-in period, no cancellation fees.',
  },
  {
    id: 15,
    question: 'What happens to my data if I cancel?',
    answer:
      'Your data is retained for 30 days after cancellation in case you want to reactivate. After that period it is permanently deleted from our systems.',
  },
