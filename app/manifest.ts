/**
 * PWA manifest — makes Chippi installable to the realtor's home screen.
 *
 * Realtors live between showings; a tab they have to remember to open is
 * dramatically less useful than an icon next to their phone app drawer.
 * The manifest alone gives the "Add to Home Screen" prompt + branded
 * splash on iOS 16.4+, Chrome desktop/mobile, Edge, and Safari macOS 17+.
 *
 * Push notifications are a separate piece — they need a service worker
 * registration + subscription endpoint + APNs/FCM relay. iOS PWA push has
 * silent-failure modes (Safari kills subs when the SW receives a push
 * but doesn't display a notification; EU PWAs lose push entirely under
 * the DMA fallout). For the actual mobile push story we wrap the same
 * Next.js app with Capacitor and ride native APNs/FCM. This manifest is
 * the floor — install + branding + the option to subscribe to web push
 * later if we want it.
 *
 * Theme color matches the dark-mode background token in globals.css.
 * Background color is white for the splash so the dark logo reads.
