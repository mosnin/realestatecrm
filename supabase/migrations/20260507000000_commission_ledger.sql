-- ============================================================================
-- Commission Ledger: brokerage-scoped commission rows on won deals
-- ============================================================================
-- Why this exists
--   Before this migration, broker payouts were computed on the fly in memory
--   from Deal.value * Deal.commissionRate whenever a dashboard was rendered.
--   That worked for a "what's GCI looking like this month" glance, but left
--   brokers with no month-end artifact: nothing to reconcile against bank
--   deposits, nothing to hand to bookkeeping, nothing that survived a rate
--   change or a deal edit. The CommissionLedger is that artifact — one row
--   per won deal, amounts frozen at close time, statuses the API can move
--   from 'pending' to 'paid' or 'void' as money actually moves.
--
-- Trigger points (see sync_commission_ledger below)
--   * AFTER INSERT ON "Deal" FOR EACH ROW           WHEN NEW.status = 'won'
--   * AFTER UPDATE OF status ON "Deal" FOR EACH ROW WHEN OLD.status IS DISTINCT
--                                                        FROM NEW.status
--                                                    AND NEW.status = 'won'
--   Both fire the same plpgsql function, which resolves the deal's Space to
--   a brokerageId + ownerId, snapshots the brokerage's current default rates,
--   and inserts one ledger row. Deals in non-brokerage workspaces
--   (Space.brokerageId IS NULL) are silently skipped — solo agents don't
--   need a ledger.
--
-- Snapshot semantics (important for the API / UI agents)
--   Rates live on Brokerage as defaults, but every ledger row captures its
--   own agentRate / brokerRate / referralRate at write time. Changing a
--   brokerage's default rates tomorrow does NOT retroactively alter any
--   historical ledger row's amounts. Re-computation is an explicit decision
--   (edit the row, or void + re-insert) — never a side effect of a rate
--   bump. This is the whole point of having a ledger in the first place.
--
-- Idempotency
--   UNIQUE ("dealId") + ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING means status can flip
--   won -> active -> won -> lost -> won and the ledger never duplicates.
--   First transition into 'won' wins; later transitions are no-ops. If a
--   broker genuinely needs to recalculate, the API should void the existing
--   row (status='void') and insert a replacement manually.
