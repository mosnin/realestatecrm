"""Autonomous agent runs.

An autonomous run is kicked off three ways, all landing in
`run_agent_for_space`:
  - the 4-hour cron sweep (`vercel.json` → `/api/cron/agent-sweep`),
  - the "Run now" button,
  - an event trigger drained from the Redis list (`/api/agent/trigger`
    pushes a new lead, a tour completed, a deal stage changed, etc.).

When the trigger list is empty the prompt puts Chippi in sweep mode — look
for stale leads / stalled deals on its own.

Runs are skipped when the agent is disabled for the space or its daily
token budget is exhausted. Every contact-facing action drafts; nothing is
sent without the realtor's approval — that draft-only boundary is the
trust model, so there is no separate pre-run approval gate.

Security: spaceId is set once in AgentContext and flows through
RunContextWrapper. No tool ever accepts spaceId as an argument.
