"""LLM provider — OpenRouter.

The agent (chat + autonomous runs, swarm, memory embeddings)
routes every model call through OpenRouter. OpenRouter is OpenAI-API
compatible, so this is a base-URL + key swap on the OpenAI client.

`configure_agents_sdk()` points the OpenAI Agents SDK's default client at
OpenRouter — that covers every `Agent` run (chat_turn, autonomous,
swarm members). `get_llm_client()` is for the direct `AsyncOpenAI` calls
(swarm planning/audit, memory embeddings).

Fallback: when `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is absent everything falls back to
calling OpenAI directly with `OPENAI_API_KEY`, so a deploy without the
OpenRouter secret keeps working.

Keep CHAT_MODELS / DEFAULT_CHAT_MODEL in sync with lib/llm.ts.
