"""LLM provider — OpenRouter.

The agent (chat + autonomous runs, swarm, memory embeddings)
routes every model call through OpenRouter. OpenRouter is OpenAI-API
compatible, so this is a base-URL + key swap on the OpenAI client.

`configure_agents_sdk()` points the OpenAI Agents SDK's default client at
OpenRouter — that covers every `Agent` run (chat_turn, autonomous,
swarm members). `get_llm_client()` is for the direct `AsyncOpenAI` calls
(swarm planning/audit, memory embeddings).

Fallback: when `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is absent everything falls back to
calling OpenAI directly with `OPENAI_API_KEY`, so a deploy without the
OpenRouter secret keeps working.

Prompt caching (Phase 2 + Phase 3):
  Provider detection drives caching strategy per turn.
  - anthropic: explicit `cache_control: {type: 'ephemeral'}` markers
    attached to the system message and the last tool. ~90% input-token
    discount on cached prefixes after first hit.
  - google (Phase 3): SAME `cache_control: {type: 'ephemeral'}` shape on
    OpenRouter — confirmed in OpenRouter's prompt-caching docs (Gemini
    explicit caching uses Anthropic-compatible breakpoints). ~75% discount.
    Min cache write is ~4096 tokens (vs Anthropic's 1024) so smaller turns
    may not cache, but the marker is harmless.
  - openai / deepseek: automatic on stable prefixes >1024 tokens. Phase 1
    already keeps the system prompt + tool list stable, so the provider
    caches without explicit markers. ~50% discount on cached input.
  - xai / moonshotai / qwen / unknown: no caching path on OpenRouter today.
    Phase 1's prompt trim is the only saving.

Keep CHAT_MODELS / DEFAULT_CHAT_MODEL in sync with lib/llm.ts.
