"""Composio integration loader for the Modal agent.

Dual-path:
- CURATED — pre-loads FunctionTool wrappers for the top-N most-used actions
  per toolkit (see integrations_curated.py). These skip the dispatcher's
  two-hop find→call round trip, killing ~3-5s of perceived latency on the
  common cases (gmail_send_email, googlecalendar_events_list, etc.).
- DISPATCHER — find_integration_tool + call_integration_tool stay as
  fallback for the long tail (any Composio action not in the curated
  allowlist, or whose schema fetch failed at build time).

Total tool count is hard-capped at MAX_TOTAL_TOOLS to stay well under
xAI's 200-tool ceiling. With ~30 native + 4-8 curated × 4 toolkits + 2
dispatcher ≈ 60-70 total in the realistic case. The cap is a guard rail
against a future expansion that forgets the ceiling exists.

Empty list on any failure path (no toolkits connected, proxy not
configured, schema fetch error) — chat must keep working on the native
catalog regardless of Composio's state.
