"""Planning tool — structure and announce a multi-step execution plan.

This is a meta-tool: it doesn't write to the CRM or call any external
service. Its job is to emit a structured plan event before the agent
executes a sequence of steps, so the realtor can see what's coming in
the activity feed and in the chat stream.

The agent MUST call create_plan when a task requires 3 or more tool calls
across different contacts, deals, or calendar events. Single-entity lookups
and simple one-step tasks should NOT trigger planning — the overhead is not
worth it.

After calling create_plan, the agent executes the steps in the announced
order. The plan is advisory: the agent may skip a step if a lookup returns
nothing, but it should not add unannounced steps.
