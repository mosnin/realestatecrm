"""Broker tool registry — Chippi-for-Brokers.

The brokerage-side agent has its own tool catalog, distinct from the realtor
agent's `agent/chippi.py:make_chippi_agent` toolbelt. Where the realtor side
acts on a single workspace's CRM, the broker side reads across the whole
brokerage's swarm of realtor spaces.

BROKER_TOOLS now carries the FULL chief-of-staff catalog — 13 tools across
five groups. The registry is NOT empty; the agent reads + writes across the
brokerage through these.

Read tools (7):
  - team_health, realtor_performance, read_realtor_morning_story (team.py)
  - find_stuck_deals, find_unassigned_leads (pipeline.py)
  - commission_report (revenue.py)
  - audit_response_times (performance.py)

Write tools (6 — the "command your team" suite, every one audit-gated):
  - reassign_lead, flag_deal_for_broker_review (actions.py)
  - send_team_announcement (actions.py)
  - change_member_role, offboard_member (actions.py — both with confirmation gates)
  - set_routing_rule (actions.py)

Adding a new broker tool:
  1. Create or open `agent/tools/broker/<group>.py` and add a coroutine
     decorated with `@function_tool`. Its first line MUST be
     `require_broker_role(ctx)` (defense layer 3 — see `_guards.py`).
  2. Collect tools in a module-level list (e.g. `TEAM_TOOLS`).
  3. Import that list here and extend BROKER_TOOLS with it.

The agent runtime (`agent/chippi_broker.py:make_broker_agent`) reads
BROKER_TOOLS at agent-build time, exactly mirroring how `agent/chippi.py`
reads its own native tool imports for the realtor agent.
