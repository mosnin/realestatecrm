# STYLESHEET.md

The design system in one place. Read this before adding a UI element.

If you find yourself doing something not described here, the answer is almost
always "no, do the thing on this page instead." The product gets cohesion the
same way a building does — every door, every window, every handle obeys the
same vocabulary.

---

## The one idea

Chippi feels **calm, paper-flat, and quietly confident**.

A realtor opens it and the surface gets out of the way. There are no shadows,
no gradients, no celebrations. The chrome recedes. The work — names, numbers,
drafts — is the only thing that's loud. Brand orange exists, but it's earned;
it does not decorate.

If a screen feels busy, you have too many things competing to be the focal
element. Every page has **one** focal element. Find it. Cut everything else
back a layer.

---

## Principles

1. **Paper-flat.** No drop shadows, no glassmorphism, no inset highlights.
   Hairline borders (`border-border/60` or `/70`) carry the structure.
2. **Neutral-first.** Backgrounds, surfaces, text, and primary buttons are all
   in the neutral scale. Color is reserved for meaning (brand, lead tier,
   destructive).
3. **One focal element per screen.** Title + status sentence is the loud note.
   Section headings recede. Body recedes further. Muted labels recede furthest.
4. **Configuration is failure to decide.** If you're choosing between two
   variants of a thing, pick one and delete the other. Tabs, settings, and
   toggles are confessions that the team couldn't choose.
5. **Quiet authority in copy.** Lowercase verbs, periods at the end of toasts,
   no exclamation marks unless something genuinely warrants celebration.
6. **Sweat the corner radius and the silence.** Spacing, easing, and stop-time
   between micro-interactions are not optional details — they are the design.
7. **The agent has a single voice.** When Chippi appears anywhere — toast,
   draft card, activity row, badge — it carries the same orange + serif
   signature. Nothing else does.

## Stack & libraries

| Layer | What we use |
|---|---|
| Framework | **Next.js 15** (App Router, RSC), **React 19** |
| Styling | **Tailwind v4** + `cn()` (clsx + tailwind-merge). No CSS modules. CSS variables via `app/globals.css`. |
| Component library | **shadcn/ui** style `new-york`, baseColor `zinc`, CSS variables on. Built on **Radix UI** primitives (`@radix-ui/react-dialog`, `-popover`, `-label`, `-accordion`, `radix-ui` umbrella). |
| Icons | **lucide-react**. Only library used. Sizes 11–13 in chrome, 14–16 in primary actions. |
| Animation | **framer-motion** (`motion` package alias also installed). All variants in `lib/motion.ts`. No GSAP for product surfaces (it's installed for marketing-only `hero-section-1.tsx`). |
| DnD | `@dnd-kit/core` + `/sortable` + `/utilities` — kanban only. |
| Forms | `react-hook-form` + `@hookform/resolvers` + `zod`. |
| Toasts | **sonner**. Single source: `app/layout.tsx` mounts `<Toaster>`. |
| Charts | **recharts** v3. Chrome lives in `components/ui/chart.tsx`. |
| Auth | **Clerk** (`@clerk/nextjs`). Component overrides in `globals.css` `.cl-*` selectors. |
| Data | **Supabase** (`@supabase/supabase-js`) + browser client in `lib/supabase-browser.ts`, server in `lib/supabase.ts`. |
| Realtime | Supabase Postgres CDC via `hooks/use-realtime.ts`. |
| Fonts | **Product**: all system / local — SF Pro from the OS, Times New Roman as the serif. **Logged-out site**: marketing/auth display type uses the `.font-brand` utility bound to `--font-brand`, currently the clean system display stack (SF Pro Display). No web font is loaded. Swap the one `--font-brand` line in `globals.css` to wire a distinct display face. |

If a feature looks like it needs a new dep, the bar is high — it almost never does. The list above is the whole vocabulary.

## Color

### Tokens (defined in `app/globals.css` — read it; don't invent new ones)

```
--background        white in light, near-black in dark
--foreground        near-black in light, off-white in dark
--surface           one half-step off the background (subtle inset)
--card              elevated content (same as background in light)
--muted             #f4f4f5 / dark equivalent — quiet bg
--muted-foreground  #6b6f76 / #9ca3af — secondary text
--border            #e7e7e9 / #27272a — hairlines
--ring              translucent foreground — focus rings

--primary           = foreground. Black on white, white on black. NOT orange.
--destructive       red

--brand             #ff964f — Chippi orange
--brand-foreground  white
--brand-subtle      #fff4eb / #2a1f17 — washed orange tint

--lead-hot          red    — leadScore ≥ 70
--lead-warm         mustard — leadScore 50–69 (note: NOT amber, NOT brand)
--lead-cold         blue
```

### Where to reach for what

| Need | Token |
|---|---|
| Default button background | `bg-foreground` (black) — **never** brand |
| Page background | `bg-background` |
| Card / row hover | `hover:bg-foreground/[0.04]` (preferred; matches the ghost-button vocabulary). `hover:bg-muted/30` is a legacy alias still in use across older surfaces — both legal, but new code should reach for `bg-foreground/[0.04]` because it lands tactile in light mode where muted/30 nearly disappears. |
| Hairline divider / border | `border-border/60` between sections, `border-border/70` on cards |
| Empty-state container | `bg-muted/20` + `border-dashed border-border/70` + `rounded-xl` |
| Section heading text | `text-muted-foreground` |
| Body text | `text-foreground` (default) or `text-muted-foreground` (subtitle) |

### The brand orange rule

Brand orange (`--brand`, `text-orange-500`, `text-orange-600 dark:text-orange-400`) lives in **only these five places**:

| Context (constant in `lib/colors.ts`) | Where | Built in |
|---|---|---|
| `LOGO` | The logo + wordmark + onboarding brand wash | `components/ui/brand-logo.tsx`, `components/onboarding/onboarding-shell.tsx` |
| `CHIPPI_AVATAR` | Chip widget in composer/header/toast; `ChippiWordmarkInline` (serif "Chippi" in prose, used at most once per surface) | `components/agent/chippi-avatar.tsx`, `components/agent/chippi-authored.tsx` |
| `AGENT_BADGE` | Authorship pill on AgentDraft rows, conversation messages, activity rows; the 4px `ChippiAuthoredDot` on Chippi-actored rows | `components/agent/agent-generated-badge.tsx`, `components/agent/chippi-authored.tsx` |
| `ACTIVITY_BAR` | Progress fill on autonomous-run activity bars and in-flight indicators | `components/agent/lead-score-bar.tsx` and equivalents |
| `LEAD_WARM` | Lead-warm tier indicator (mustard, not orange — but conceptually adjacent) | `components/agent/lead-score-bar.tsx` |

It does **not** appear on default buttons, primary CTAs, links, focus rings,
nav, or "active" indicators. Those are all foreground (black/white). If you
catch yourself reaching for orange on a non-Chippi element, that's the bug.

The five contexts are codified as `BRAND_ORANGE_CONTEXTS` in `lib/colors.ts`,
along with a `brandOrange()` wrapper for tagging deliberate usage. Adding a
sixth context requires deleting one of the existing five — discipline lives
in the constraint, not in this paragraph.

#### `CHIPPI_PILL` — the one pill that wears the brand

`PRIMARY_PILL` is the locked primary pill (foreground bg). Buttons that
DIRECTLY invoke Chippi ("Tell Chippi", "Ask Chippi", "Chippi, help with this")
use `CHIPPI_PILL` instead: same vocabulary, but the hover state shifts to a
barely-perceptible warm halo so the realtor feels Chippi at the moment they
reach for the button. Reach for `CHIPPI_PILL` only on buttons that name
Chippi explicitly — otherwise, `PRIMARY_PILL` stays the default.

#### Enforcement

`tests/style/no-stray-orange.test.ts` fails CI when a file in
`STRICT_DIRS` uses an `*-orange-*` class without importing
`brandOrange` (or `CHIPPI_PILL`, or being one of the named leaf
components). The strict zone grows directory by directory as we audit
+ tag the existing call sites.

---

## Type

### Fonts

| Variable | Stack | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `--font-sans` | -apple-system, SF Pro Text/Display, system-ui | Body, default |
| `--font-heading` | SF Pro Display, system-ui | All `<h*>` (auto via base layer) |
| `--font-title` | **Times New Roman**, Times, serif | Page-level h1 only |
| `--font-mono` | SF Mono, ui-monospace | Code, data, numbers in dense tables |

The serif Times is the **brand's quiet flourish**. Use it on page titles and
on focal stat numbers. Never on body, never on UI chrome, never on more than
one element on a page. The whole reason it works is scarcity.

### The hierarchy (from `lib/typography.ts`)

```
H1            30px  text-3xl  tracking-tight  + serif Times       — page title
STAT_NUMBER   30px  text-3xl  tracking-tight  tabular-nums serif  — focal data
STAT_COMPACT  25px  text-[25px] tabular-nums                       — 4+ in a row
H2            21px  text-[21px] font-semibold                      — section
H3            17px  text-[17px] font-semibold                      — card head
BODY          14px  text-sm                                        — default
BODY_MUTED    14px  text-sm muted                                  — subtitle / helper
BODY_COMPACT  14px  (alias of BODY)                                — dense surfaces
CAPTION       12px  text-xs muted                                  — chrome / metadata
META          11px  text-[11px] tabular-nums muted                 — timestamp / id
SECTION_LABEL 11px  text-[11px] uppercase tracking-wider muted     — small caps
```

### The ratio rule

The ladder is snapped to a **1.2 modular ratio** — the Pythagorean minor
third, the harmonic step the eye reads as proportional rather than
arbitrary. Reading the ladder top-down: each step is the previous step
divided by 1.2 (rounded to whole px). `30 → 25 → 21 → 17 → 14 → 12`.

The **11px meta floor** sits one step BELOW the ratio (the strict
ladder would put it at 10) by deliberate exception. 10px reads as
"squinting" — the legibility floor for chrome metadata is 11. Below the
music, but above silence. The exception is named so future additions
don't try to invent a tier at 10.

There are also **dead intervals** in the ladder. Do not add a tier:
- between BODY (14) and CAPTION (12) — the old 13px BODY_COMPACT was a
  dead interval the eye couldn't sense as a distinct step. It's now an
  alias of BODY.
- between H3 (17) and H2 (21) — no 19px tier earns its place.

**Apply via `cn(...)` from `lib/typography.ts`.** Don't hand-roll text classes
on a new page. If a new page needs a size that isn't in the file, that's a
sign the page is wrong, not the file.

### The status-sentence pattern

Every page header looks like this:

```tsx
<header className="space-y-1.5">
  <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">Reviews.</p>
  <h1
    className="text-3xl tracking-tight text-foreground"
    style={{ fontFamily: 'var(--font-title)' }}
  >
    Deals flagged for you
  </h1>
  <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">{statusSentence}</p>
</header>
```

Three lines: muted greeting line (with period) → serif h1 → one-sentence
status. Same shape on Chippi home, Reviews, agent-activity, broker overview.
**Don't break the pattern.** It's how the surface reads as one product.

---

## Space

```
PAGE_RHYTHM    space-y-12   48px  between major sections
SECTION_RHYTHM space-y-6    24px  within a section
FIELD_RHYTHM   space-y-4    16px  between form fields / list rows
ROW_PAD        py-3         12px  hairline-divided rows (or py-2.5 for tight)
```

### The harmonic spacing ladder

The spacing scale is already on a harmonic ladder by good luck and good
intuition. Reading top-down: `48 → 24 → 16 → 12` traces an octave
(2:1) → perfect fifth (3:2) → perfect fourth (4:3) — the Pythagorean
descent. **Do not insert intermediate steps.** A new value between any
two rungs is a sign the design is reaching for something that doesn't
exist in the harmonic.

### Containers

| Width | When |
|---|---|
| `max-w-5xl mx-auto` | Broker overview, dashboard pages |
| `max-w-4xl mx-auto` | Reviews, focused list views |
| `max-w-3xl mx-auto` | Chat, settings, intake — single-column reading |
| `max-w-[1500px]` | Wide tables, kanban |
| `max-w-[868px]` | **FocusCard** — golden inset of the 1404px content column |

Always paired with `pb-12` so the page has bottom breathing room.

### Geometry — the FocusCard rule

The realtor's primary surface is the FocusCard. It sits inside the
1500px page max minus 2 × 48px content padding at `lg`, giving an
inner content column of **1404px**. The card itself is **868px**.

`1404 / 868 ≈ 1.618 = φ` — the golden ratio.

The card is the golden rectangle inscribed in the column. The
remaining 268px of left + right shoulder is the golden complement
that lets the card feel deliberate rather than small.

If you add a new focal element to a wide page, hold it against this
test: is its width the column's width divided by φ? If not, name
why. "It felt about right" is not a reason.

### Geometry — the Vitruvian macro frame (Phase 6)

The macro frame now lives in **`lib/geometry.ts`** — one module, one
derivation. Every layout width above ~200px imports its value from
there. Two honest number families do the work:

**Rhythm family** — multiples of `RHYTHM_U = 48` (the top of the
harmonic spacing ladder 48 → 24 → 16 → 12, the Pythagorean
octave → fifth → fourth):

| Token | Formula | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `SIDEBAR_WIDTH_PX` | `RHYTHM_U × 5` | 240 |
| `CHIPPI_BAR_WIDTH_PX` | `RHYTHM_U × 16` | 768 |
| `PAGE_PAD_LG_PX` | `RHYTHM_U × 1` | 48 |

**φ family** — the FocusCard inscribed inside the column:

| Token | Formula | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `PAGE_MAX_PX` | The design ceiling (chosen, not derived) | 1500 |
| `CONTENT_COLUMN_PX` | `PAGE_MAX_PX − 2 × PAGE_PAD_LG_PX` | 1404 |
| `FOCUS_CARD_WIDTH_PX` | `round(CONTENT_COLUMN_PX / φ)` | 868 |

**Chrome exception** — `SIDEBAR_COLLAPSED_PX = 56` is the icon-rail
convention; it's NOT on the rhythm lattice and the module names it as
the one exception so it can't be silently absorbed and drift.

**The rule.** Don't write bare px widths above ~200px in JSX or CSS.
Import the token. If you need a new macro width, derive it from one
of the two families and add it to `lib/geometry.ts` with the formula
in a comment — never as a magic number at the call site. A regression
test in `tests/lib/geometry.test.ts` locks the lattice so a value
can't drift without an intentional commit.

---

## Surfaces

### The hairline-divider grid

For stat strips and snapshots, **always** use this trick:

```tsx
<section className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-px rounded-xl overflow-hidden
                    border border-border/60 bg-border/60">
  <div className="bg-background px-4 py-4">…</div>
  <div className="bg-background px-4 py-4">…</div>
  <div className="bg-background px-4 py-4">…</div>
</section>
```

Background color shows through the `gap-px` to make 1px dividers between
cells. It looks like printed paper. It's the snapshot vocabulary; don't
invent a different one.

### Cards

```
bg-card  border border-border/70  rounded-xl  px-4 py-3
```

Hover (when interactive): `hover:bg-muted/30 transition-colors`.

### Rows

`<ul className="divide-y divide-border/60">` with each `<li>` using
`flex items-center gap-3 py-3`. No card chrome on individual rows — the
divider is the structure.

### Empty states

Always:

```tsx
<div className="rounded-xl border border-dashed border-border/70
                bg-muted/20 px-5 py-10 text-center">
  <p className="text-sm text-foreground">{calmHeadline}</p>
  <p className="text-xs text-muted-foreground mt-1">{whatsNext}</p>
</div>
```

The headline is the calm fact ("You're all caught up.", "Nothing flagged.
Quiet day.", "quiet — no activity yet"). The second line says what would
populate it.

---

## Border & radius

### Radius (defined in `globals.css`)

```
--radius        0.75rem   (12px)  — base
--card-radius   0.75rem   (12px)  — content cards
```

Tailwind derives the rest from `--radius`:

| Class | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `rounded-sm` | `calc(--radius - 4px)` = 8px | Tiny pills, dense inline chips |
| `rounded-md` | `calc(--radius - 2px)` = 10px | **Buttons, inputs** — canonical control radius |
| `rounded-lg` | `var(--radius)` = 12px | Dialogs, alert dialogs |
| `rounded-xl` | `calc(--radius + 4px)` = 16px | **Content cards, stat grids, empty-state containers** |
| `rounded-2xl` | n/a (bare Tailwind) | Marketing-only pages — do not use in product |
| `rounded-full` | full | Pills, segmented controls, avatars, primary CTA pill |

The product gets one canonical control radius (`rounded-md`) and one
canonical content radius (`rounded-xl`). Mixing these is the look. Don't
introduce a third.

### Border weight + color

- **All product borders are 1px.** No 2px, no 3px. Tailwind default.
- **Color**: `border-border/60` between sections (slightly translucent so
  hairlines feel like paper folds), `border-border/70` on cards and inputs,
  `border-border` on tables and clear separators.
- **Dashed**: only on empty-state containers (`border-dashed border-border/70`).
- **Active rail** (the 2px black strip on the active sidebar item):
  `absolute left-0 top-1.5 bottom-1.5 w-[2px] rounded-r bg-foreground`.
  This is the one place 2px appears on a border. Don't replicate elsewhere.

### When to use a border vs nothing

- A grouped list of rows: `divide-y divide-border/60`. No outer border.
- A standalone surface (stat grid, card, empty state): outer border + radius.
- A button: outline variant only, never default/ghost.
- Sections within a page: a single `border-b border-border/60` *under the
  section heading*, not around the section.

---

## Shadows

**Paper-flat is the rule.** The redesign deliberately removed shadows from
buttons, inputs, cards, and the outline button variant. If you find yourself
reaching for a `shadow-*` class on a product surface, the answer is almost
always no — use a hairline border instead. On a *selected* state, use a
`ring-2 ring-foreground/10 ring-offset-2` ring instead of `shadow-sm` —
same lift signal without breaking the paper feel.

Shadows live in exactly four places at the system level:

| Where | Class | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Sonner toast | `shadow-lg shadow-foreground/5` | Toasts float above the page; without lift they read as misplaced banners. The 5% foreground tint keeps the shadow subtle. |
| Dialog / AlertDialog content | `shadow-lg` | Same reason — modals must read as elevated. |
| Chart tooltips | `shadow-xl` | Hover surfaces over data; need clear separation from the chart. |
| `recharts` tooltip in `components/ui/chart.tsx` | `shadow-xl` | Same as above. |

Marketing pages (`app/features/*`, `components/ui/hero-section-1.tsx`,
`floating-chat-widget`, etc.) DO use `shadow-sm` / `shadow-xl` /
`shadow-2xl`. **The product does not.** When working in `app/s/[slug]/*`,
`app/broker/*`, or any dashboard component, leave shadows in the marketing
layer and use borders instead.

### Enforcement

`tests/style/no-shadow-on-product-chrome.test.ts` fails CI when a
shadow class appears in a strict directory outside the allowlist.
The strict directory list grows one at a time as we audit + clean
surfaces — promoting a directory is a one-way door. The file's
`STRICT_DIRS_TODO` list shows the migration backlog.

Strict today: `components/onboarding`, `components/agent`,
`components/chippi` (the brand-heavy dirs). The docked Chippi composer
(`chippi-bar.tsx`) is allowlisted — it's a floating surface, same class
as a toast. Remaining backlog: `components/contacts`, `components/deals`,
`components/dashboard`, `components/settings`, `app/s`, `app/broker`.

---

## Components

### Buttons

**One source: `components/ui/button.tsx`.** Use the cva variants. Don't
hand-roll a button.

### Sizes (kept lean)

```
xs       h-6   rare; small inline pills
sm       h-8
default  h-9   matches sidebar nav rows — the canonical size
lg       h-10
icon{,-sm,-lg,-xs}  square equivalents
```

### Variants

| Variant | Background | When |
|---|---|---|
| `default` | foreground (black/white) | Primary action — Save, Send, Add |
| `outline` | transparent + `border-border` | Secondary action |
| `ghost` | transparent, hover `bg-foreground/[0.04]` | Tertiary, in-line |
| `secondary` | `bg-secondary` | Mid-emphasis |
| `link` | text only, underline on hover | Inline link |
| `destructive` | red | Delete, irreversible |

### Press feedback (do not omit)

```
transition-all duration-150
active:scale-[0.98]                  (except on link variant)
focus-visible:ring-2 ring-ring/40 ring-offset-2 ring-offset-background
```

The 0.98 press is tactile and feels like real product. The 2px focus ring
(not the shadcn 3px default) keeps focus visible without screaming.

### Pill primary (when a button has to feel like a CTA)

`PRIMARY_PILL` from `lib/typography.ts` — `rounded-full px-4 h-9
bg-foreground text-background`. Use on inline composer Send buttons, locked
primary actions, anywhere the rectangle button feels too generic.

### Inputs

**One source: `components/ui/input.tsx`.** Same polish rules as buttons.

```
h-9                              canonical control height (matches buttons)
rounded-md                       same radius as buttons
border border-input              hairline only (input == border alias)
bg-transparent                   sits on the page; dark: bg-input/30
text-base on mobile, text-sm md+ prevents iOS focus zoom
placeholder:text-muted-foreground/70   quieter than default
focus-visible:border-ring        ring color shifts the border too
focus-visible:ring-2 ring-ring/30 ring-offset-1 ring-offset-background
transition-colors duration-150
```

No shadow. No floating effect. The original input had `shadow-xs` and was
removed in the redesign — paper-flat is the rule.

For `<textarea>`: same vocabulary, `min-h-[80px]` typical.

For `<Label>`: small text-foreground, `text-sm font-medium`. Pair with
inputs via `Label htmlFor` — accessibility is not optional.

### Cards

**One source: `components/ui/card.tsx`.**

```
bg-card  text-card-foreground  flex flex-col
gap-4    py-4
rounded-lg  border
```

`CardHeader` uses `px-5` and a 1.5-gap layout that supports an optional
trailing action slot. `CardTitle` is `font-semibold leading-none`.
`CardContent` and `CardFooter` are `px-5`.

Use Card when the content is **a discrete unit** that needs visual
separation — onboarding nudges, invitation prompts, settings groups.
**Do not** wrap every list row in a Card. For lists, use
`divide-y divide-border/60`.

For inline / hand-rolled card-shaped elements (review rows, agent activity
rows), use the lighter pattern:

```
rounded-xl  border border-border/70  bg-card  px-4 py-3
hover:bg-muted/30  transition-colors
```

That's the row vocabulary. Distinct from the Card primitive — used where
ten of these stack and the heavier Card would feel chunky.

### Modals (Dialog + AlertDialog)

**Sources: `components/ui/dialog.tsx`, `components/ui/alert-dialog.tsx`.**
Both built on Radix primitives.

```
Overlay   fixed inset-0 z-50 bg-black/50
          data-[state] animate-in/out fade-out-0 fade-in-0
Content   fixed top-[50%] left-[50%] translate-(-50%,-50%) z-50
          grid w-full max-w-[calc(100%-2rem)] sm:max-w-lg
          gap-4 rounded-lg border border-border/70 p-6
          shadow-lg duration-200
          data-[state] zoom-out-95 / zoom-in-95
Close X   absolute top-4 right-4 size-4 stroke
Header    flex flex-col gap-2 text-center sm:text-left
Footer    flex flex-col-reverse sm:flex-row sm:justify-end gap-2
Title     text-lg font-semibold leading-none
Desc      text-sm text-muted-foreground
```

Use AlertDialog (not Dialog) for **destructive or irreversible** actions.
The "Pause me?" disable-Chippi confirmation is the canonical example.
AlertDialog gates with two buttons (Cancel + Action), forces a choice,
and the Action button uses the destructive variant when warranted.

For `<ConfirmDialog>` (`components/ui/confirm-dialog.tsx`), use it for
inline confirms inside row contexts. Same modal chrome, programmatic API.

### Badges & pills

**One source: `components/ui/badge.tsx`** (cva variants).

```
rounded-full  px-2 py-0.5  text-xs font-medium
gap-1  whitespace-nowrap  inline-flex
[&>svg]:size-3
```

Variants: `default` (foreground bg) / `secondary` (muted bg) /
`destructive` / `outline` / `ghost` / `link`. Match the button vocabulary.

For the **inline status pill** pattern (Open/Approved/Closed on review
rows, scoreLabel chips, draft channel labels), use the hand-rolled pattern
that pairs a tone-tinted bg with a tone-tinted text:

```
inline-flex text-xs font-medium rounded-full px-2.5 py-0.5
text-amber-700  bg-amber-50  dark:text-amber-400  dark:bg-amber-500/15
```

Tone palette for status pills:

| Status | Light | Dark |
|---|---|---|
| Open / pending / awaiting | amber-700 / amber-50 | amber-400 / amber-500/15 |
| Approved / done / responded | emerald-700 / emerald-50 | emerald-400 / emerald-500/15 |
| Closed / dismissed / quiet | muted-foreground / muted | (same) |
| Destructive / failed / unsubscribed | rose-700 / rose-50 | rose-400 / rose-500/15 |
| Agent-authored | orange-600 / orange-500/10 | orange-400 / orange-500/15 |

These tone classes are the only place we leave the neutral palette in
chrome. Use sparingly — a row should have at most one status pill.

### Tables

**Source: `components/ui/table.tsx`** — minimal, header-only border.

```
Container   relative w-full overflow-x-auto
Table       w-full caption-bottom text-sm
Header      [&_tr]:border-b
Body        [&_tr:last-child]:border-0
Row         border-b transition-colors hover:bg-muted/50 data-[state=selected]:bg-muted
Head cell   h-10 px-2 text-left align-middle text-muted-foreground font-medium text-xs
Cell        p-2 align-middle
```

Use `<Table>` for genuine tabular data — broker leaderboard, audit logs,
analytics. For the dashboard's per-realtor list (where you want avatars,
flowing text, and inline metadata) use the **divide-y row list** pattern
instead — tables read as bureaucratic; the row list reads as a feed.

Rule of thumb: if every cell is a number or a date, Table. If a cell is a
sentence, divide-y rows.

---

## Motion

**One library: `framer-motion`.** All variants live in `lib/motion.ts`.

### Timing

```
DURATION_FAST  0.15s   hover, color shifts, micro
DURATION_BASE  0.22s   page entrance, list stagger
DURATION_SLOW  0.32s   bar fills, rare emphasis
```

### Easing

```
EASE_OUT     [0.16, 1, 0.3, 1]   premium ease-out cubic — entrances
EASE_IN_OUT  [0.4, 0, 0.2, 1]    symmetric — toggles, returns
```

### The two patterns we use

**Stagger list** — every list of rows on the dashboard.

```tsx
import { StaggerList, StaggerItem } from '@/components/motion/stagger-list';

<StaggerList key={listKey} className="space-y-2 (or divide-y…)">
  {rows.map((r) => <StaggerItem key={r.id}>…</StaggerItem>)}
</StaggerList>
```

When the list contents change (filter, tab swap, window change), key the
StaggerList so it remounts and the children re-stagger in. **Don't add
exit animations to list items** — items leaving on filter is jumpy. The
key remount handles the swap.

**Shared layout (`layoutId`)** — segmented controls and sliding tab
indicators.

```tsx
{isActive && (
  <motion.span
    layoutId="reviews-tab-underline"   // pick one id per indicator group
    className="absolute bottom-[-1px] left-2 right-2 h-[2px]
               rounded-full bg-foreground"
    transition={{ duration: DURATION_BASE, ease: EASE_OUT }}
  />
)}
```

The active indicator's underline / pill / chip shares an id across siblings.
Framer Motion animates between positions on swap. This is the iOS
segmented-control trick. **Use it for any tab strip or window selector.**

### What we do NOT do

- No bounce / spring overshoot. Eases land flat.
- No spinning loaders longer than 1s before they get a status line.
- No celebratory motion (confetti, big checkmarks) unless you can defend it
  in a meeting. We have `confetti.tsx` — it's used once.
- No animating numbers up. The number is the substance; flashing it around
  is decoration.

---

## Voice

The product talks like a sharp colleague who already knows your book of business.

- Lowercase verb in toasts: `"Tour booked — Sarah Chen."` Period.
- One-sentence status lines under every page title.
- Active voice; "drafted" not "has been drafted."
- Empty states are calm facts: "You're all caught up.", "Nothing flagged.
  Quiet day.", "quiet — nothing in flight."
- Microcopy on buttons is verb-led: "Open", "Resolve", "Pause", "Run now".
- "Chippi" is the agent's name. Capitalised. Don't say "the agent" or "the
  AI" or "the assistant" anywhere user-facing.
- No emojis in product chrome. Suggestion chips are the one exception.
- No exclamation marks. Confidence doesn't shout.

---

## Navigation

### Sidebar (`components/dashboard/sidebar.tsx`)

```
Width expanded   240px   (w-[240px])
Width collapsed  56px    (w-[56px])
Background       bg-sidebar  (= card surface, white in light, near-black in dark)
Border           border-r border-border/70
Hover            hover:bg-foreground/[0.04]
Active rail      absolute left-0 top-1.5 bottom-1.5 w-[2px] rounded-r bg-foreground
Active label     text-foreground (loses muted treatment)
Icon size        15–16
Row height       h-9 (matches button default — alignment is intentional)
```

**Section labels** in the sidebar use `SECTION_LABEL` from
`lib/typography.ts`: `text-[11px] font-medium uppercase tracking-wider
text-muted-foreground`. Always above a group, never inline.

**Counts in nav rows** (unread leads, pending drafts) use the small pill:

```
inline-flex min-w-[20px] h-5 px-1.5 items-center justify-center
rounded-full text-[11px] tabular-nums flex-shrink-0
bg-secondary text-muted-foreground         (default)
bg-primary text-primary-foreground         (when count is "you owe action")
```

**Collapse/expand** is an in-place transition; don't animate the width
manually. The collapse provider (`sidebar-collapse.tsx`) handles state.

**Mobile**: sidebar is hidden; `MobileNav` (bottom bar) takes over with
the four primary items only.

### Header (`components/dashboard/header.tsx`)

```
Height           h-14 (56px) — matches collapsed sidebar width
Border           border-b border-border/70
Background       bg-background
Position         sticky top-0 z-40
Padding          px-4 md:px-6
Layout           flex items-center justify-between
```

The header is intentionally quiet — page titles live in the page body
(serif h1), not in the header. The header carries the breadcrumb / brand
mark on the left and the user/notification chrome on the right. **Don't
add a page title to the header.**

### Active state across the app

| Surface | How "active" reads |
|---|---|
| Sidebar nav row | 2px foreground rail on the left, label loses muted |
| Tabs (reviews, settings) | Sliding 2px underline via `motion.layoutId` |
| Segmented control (window selector, role switcher) | Sliding muted pill via `motion.layoutId` |
| Kanban column highlight while dragging | `bg-muted/40` |
| Form field focused | 2px ring + 1px offset |

One vocabulary: the active thing is **named with foreground**, the
inactive thing recedes to muted. No orange on active states.

---

## Visual hierarchy

The hierarchy is built from three forces: **size, weight, color**.
Loud-to-quiet from the top:

| Tier | Size | Weight | Color | When |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Page focal | 3xl serif Times | regular | foreground | Page h1, hero stat number |
| Section | xl sans | semibold | foreground | `<h2>` inside a page |
| Card / panel | base sans | semibold | foreground | `<h3>` on a card head |
| Body | sm sans | regular | foreground | Default reading |
| Subtitle / helper | sm sans | regular | muted-foreground | Status sentence, helper text |
| Section label | 11px sans | medium uppercase tracking-wider | muted-foreground | Small caps over a group |
| Caption / chrome | xs sans | regular | muted-foreground | Avatars, breadcrumbs |
| Meta / timestamp | 11px tabular-nums | regular | muted-foreground | Created at, IDs |

### What always stands out

1. **The page's one focal element.** Serif Times h1 + status sentence at
   the top of every page. Or a single big stat number. Pick one per page.
2. **The pending action.** Pending drafts count, open reviews count, the
   unreviewed item — these get the foreground pill (`bg-primary
   text-primary-foreground`) so they read as "you owe this."
3. **Chippi's authorship.** Anything authored by the agent gets the
   orange tint or the small Chippi badge. The orange in chrome is **only**
   for this; it's the brand's quiet signature.

### What always recedes

- Section dividers, hairlines, borders.
- Timestamps and IDs (always `text-[11px] tabular-nums muted`).
- Section heading labels (small caps, muted, never bold black).
- Counts that aren't actionable (use `bg-secondary text-muted-foreground`
  not the foreground pill).

If a screen feels like everything is shouting, you've used too many
foreground-color elements. Demote the secondary ones to muted; the focal
element will pull the eye on its own.

---

## Dashboard homepage (`app/s/[slug]/chippi/page.tsx`)

The Chippi workspace is the realtor's home. It is **the** product surface;
the rest of the app is in service of it.

### Layout

- **Single column, max-w-3xl, centered.** No sidebar in the content area.
  The composer is a docked `sticky bottom-0` element with a gradient mask
  fading content above it.
- **Vertical flow**: greeting (centered serif h1) → MorningReplay (only
  if there's overnight activity to show) → HowChippiWorksTip (one-time)
  → TodayFeed → composer + suggestion chips.
- **Active conversation mode** swaps the Today view for a transcript:
  `ScrollArea`, `max-w-3xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 pt-12 sm:pt-14 pb-4`,
  message list with `space-y-7` between turns.

### Hero (the first surface a realtor sees)

```tsx
<header className="space-y-1.5 text-center">
  <h1
    className="text-[2.25rem] sm:text-[2.5rem] tracking-tight leading-tight"
    style={{ fontFamily: 'var(--font-title)' }}
  >
    {greeting}, {firstName}.
  </h1>
  <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">{statusSentence()}</p>
</header>
```

The greeting uses **time-based copy** ("Good morning" / "Good afternoon"
/ "Good evening" / "Working late"). The status sentence is a one-line
narrative read of the workspace ("You have 3 leads to follow up with."
or similar).

**This is the only h1 in the product that's centered.** Everywhere else,
h1 is left-aligned. The Chippi home is centered because the surface is
intentionally calm and conversational; the rest of the app is dense and
left-aligned.

### Suggestion chips (`SUGGESTIONS` constant in chippi-workspace)

```
inline-flex items-center gap-1.5 rounded-full
border border-border/70 bg-background hover:bg-accent/40 hover:border-border
px-3 py-1
text-[11px] text-muted-foreground hover:text-foreground
transition-colors
```

The one place an emoji is allowed in product chrome — paired with a verb
phrase. Click sends the prompt; the chips disappear once the conversation
starts.

### Composer

Docked: `sticky bottom-0 z-10 w-full max-w-3xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6
pt-4 pb-[max(1rem,env(safe-area-inset-bottom))] space-y-2.5
bg-gradient-to-t from-background via-background to-background/0`. The
gradient mask fades content under the dock so the input is the bottom-
most element with no detached chips floating below it.

### What carries the most visual weight

In order:
1. The greeting + status sentence (serif, focal).
2. MorningReplay (when present — it's the "wow" moment of overnight work).
3. The composer (always reachable, rounded full pill, primary CTA inside).
4. TodayFeed rows (divide-y, calm).

Don't add a fifth focal element. If a feature wants prominence on the home,
it competes with these four — usually it should live one click away.

---

## The logged-out site (marketing + auth)

The **logged-out** surfaces are mid-migration between two systems:

- **The calm site system** (`components/marketing/site/**`) — the target. It
  matches the product: paper-flat, hairline borders, neutral-first, the serif
  Times headline the product uses for every page title, and a single foreground
  primary CTA. Orange stays the rare Chippi signature, not decoration. This is
  what the **home page** and the **shared chrome** (sticky nav + paper-flat
  footer) run on today.
- **The legacy "studio ASCII" system** (`components/marketing/fortitudo/**`,
  `components/marketing/home/**`, `marketing-*.tsx`) — the loud aesthetic
  adopted from the fortitudo studio design: an ASCII canvas field, brand-orange
  primaries, charcoal accent cards. It still powers the **sub-pages** (realtors,
  brokerages, integrations, company, pricing, status) and the **auth pages**,
  and is being migrated to the calm system route by route.

Why the home moved first: the front door makes the first-impression promise of
the whole product. Chippi's promise is *calm, in control, trustworthy* — you're
asking a realtor to hand over their inbox and their clients. A loud ASCII pitch
contradicts that the moment they arrive. The calm site says the same thing the
product says, so signing up feels like one continuous experience, not a
costume-change at the door.

**Neither system leaks into the product.** Marketing colour/shadow live behind
opt-in classes (`.font-brand`, `.text-gradient-brand`, `.rounded-marketing-*`)
or inside `components/marketing/**`. The `no-stray-orange` and
`no-shadow-on-product-chrome` tests still pass because `components/marketing`
is outside the strict zone — orange and shadows are *expected* here.

### The calm site system (`components/marketing/site/`)

| Piece | File | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Sticky nav | `nav.tsx` | Hairline-bottom bar, flat links, foreground CTA. No floating pill, no mega-menu. |
| Footer | `footer.tsx` | Paper-flat, hairline-top, muted links. No charcoal card. |
| Reveal | `reveal.tsx` | The ONLY motion: one fade + 12px rise on scroll-in, EASE_OUT, reduced-motion aware. No parallax, tilt, cursor-glow, or scroll-progress bar. |
| Theme toggle | `fortitudo/theme-toggle.tsx` | Reused as-is — wired to Chippi's `ThemeProvider`. |
| Home sections | `site/home/{hero,proof,trust,cta}.tsx` | promise → proof → trust → ask. Headlines in serif Times; mockups built from the product's own card/row/pill vocabulary. |

Headlines on the calm site use the serif Times (`var(--font-title)`) — the
product's signature flourish — not `.font-brand`. Primary CTAs are the
foreground pill (`bg-foreground`), same as the product; orange is reserved for
the Chippi mark. Trial copy is honest: a 7-day free trial that **requires a
card** ("7 days free, then $97/mo. Cancel anytime"). Never "free, no card" —
there is no free plan.

### The legacy studio-ASCII system (`components/marketing/fortitudo/`)

Still live on the sub-pages + auth until they migrate. Surviving pieces:

| Piece | File | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ASCII field | `ascii-field.tsx` | Slow canvas glyph field in Chippi orange, reads on light + dark. Behind the sub-page heroes, the auth panel, and `marketing-cta`. |
| Theme toggle | `theme-toggle.tsx` | Shared with the calm nav. |
| Marketing hero / CTA | `marketing-hero.tsx`, `marketing-cta.tsx` | ASCII hero + charcoal closing card, used by pricing + status. |

The old home chrome (floating pill `nav.tsx`, charcoal `footer.tsx`,
`scroll-progress.tsx`) and the home decoration primitives (`gradient-card`,
`spotlight-card`, `rotating-word`, `dot-flow`, `dot-loader`, `rainbow-button`)
were **deleted** when the home moved to the calm system — they were home-only.

### Where the discipline still holds (both systems)

- **Copy voice is unchanged** — calm, lowercase verbs, no exclamation marks,
  no em dashes, no invented metrics, no fabricated testimonials. Realtors/
  brokerages never get phone numbers and Chippi never texts/calls leads;
  marketing copy never implies it.
- **The product is off-limits.** If you find yourself reaching for `.font-brand`
  or `bg-brand` as a *primary* outside `components/marketing/**` or the auth
  layout, that's the bug. The product's orange rule (the five contexts) is
  untouched.

---

## Auth pages (`components/auth/auth-page-layout.tsx`)

Auth is the **first impression**, and it now wears the **studio ASCII** look
(see above): a split screen with an ASCII brand panel on the left and the
Clerk form on the right. Brand expression is allowed here in ways it isn't
in product chrome — the Clerk **primary button is brand orange**, the input
focus ring is brand, and the headline is the brand display face. Calm copy
still holds; no marketing gradients on the form chrome itself.

### Layout

```
main   relative min-h-screen bg-background grid lg:grid-cols-2

LEFT  ASCII brand panel (desktop) — AsciiField + orange wash + brand tagline
RIGHT form panel — role switcher + brand-display heading + Clerk form + ToS
      mobile: brand panel collapses to a slim ASCII signature strip on top
```

(Historical note — the previous auth layout used a cobe Globe on the right
and foreground-neutral form chrome. That was replaced wholesale by the ASCII
split when the logged-out site adopted the studio system.)

<details>
<summary>Previous (pre-redesign) auth layout reference</summary>

```
main   relative min-h-screen bg-background
       lg:flex lg:h-screen lg:overflow-y-auto lg:overflow-x-hidden

LEFT panel  (form)
       w-full min-h-screen flex flex-col bg-background
       px-6 py-6 sm:px-10 sm:py-8
       lg:min-h-0 lg:w-[480px] lg:min-w-[480px]
       lg:overflow-y-auto lg:border-r lg:border-border/70 lg:py-10

  Logo    h-6 sm:h-7   shrink-0   <BrandLogo>
  Form    mx-auto w-full max-w-[380px]   centered vertically
  Heading H1 from typography + TITLE_FONT (serif Times)
  Sub     BODY_MUTED

RIGHT panel  (brand promise)
       Visible lg+ only. Hosts the Globe, leadMarkers, and the brand
       tagline. Animates in 100ms after the form (RIGHT_PANEL_VARIANTS)
       so the form lands first.
```

### Role switcher (login pages only)

A two-tab segmented control above the form: Realtor / Broker. Lives in a
`rounded-full bg-foreground/[0.04] p-1` shell. Active tab gets
`bg-background border border-border/70`; inactive is muted-foreground
with hover→foreground.

This is the **only place** in the app where two roles split the door. Use
this exact pattern; don't invent a different role-picker elsewhere.

### Brand expression rules for auth

Auth pages are allowed:
- The **Globe** widget (`components/ui/cobe-globe.tsx`) on the right panel.
- A serif Times h1 — same h1 as the product, but here it's the screen's
  whole emotional anchor.
- Live theme awareness — the Globe re-tints in dark mode.
- A 100ms staggered entrance: form first, brand panel second. Intentional.

Auth pages are **not** allowed:
- Shadows on form chrome (Clerk's defaults are overridden in `globals.css`
  via `.cl-card`, `.cl-cardBox` to remove shadow + bg + padding + border).
- Marketing-style gradients, hero animations, or emoji.
- A different button/input vocabulary than the product. The Clerk overrides
  force `rounded-md`, `h-9`, foreground primary — same as `components/ui/button.tsx`.

The principle: auth is **calm welcome, not a pitch**. The marketing pages
do the pitch. By the time the user lands at sign-in, they've already
decided.

</details>

## Motion is earned

The product is **calm by design**. Motion is not the default — it's a
decision you defend. Most surfaces breathe through restraint: a hairline,
a fade, a hover. That restraint IS the brand. Adding a pulse, a
typewriter, or a celebration where one isn't earned is decoration, and
decoration is the thing the whole system refuses.

### The animated moments that exist (and why each earns it)

| Moment | Where | Why it's earned |
|---|---|---|
| List stagger | every dashboard list | Orients the eye as rows arrive; ends flat, no overshoot. |
| Approval sentence | `ApprovalCelebration` | The ONE beat after a realtor approves. *The sentence is the celebration — no icon, no checkmark, no pulse.* |
| Onboarding reveal | `TypingText` in the V2 reveal | The payoff of the welcome promise — the realtor watches Chippi write. The one place we spend motion freely. |
| Segmented-control slide | tabs, role switcher | `layoutId` shared-element; the iOS move. |

### The bar for adding a new animated moment

Before you add motion, answer: **what deliberate calm decision am I about
to overturn?** Read the surrounding code and the git history first. The
team has repeatedly *removed* motion on purpose:

- The morning story was demoted from a focal hero to a calm "What's new"
  list row (multiple commits). It is **not** a typewriter target — that
  would re-promote what was deliberately quieted.
- The floating "Chippi is working" activity toast was removed. Don't
  re-add a floating live indicator.
- The send-confirmation celebration is a sentence, by explicit decision.
  Don't add an orange pulse to it.

If your new moment fights one of these, it's decoration. Cut it.

### Components built ahead of an honest home

`ChippiAuthoredDot` (Phase 2) still has **no consumer yet** — on purpose.
The activity feed and "What I did" are first-person Chippi ("I drafted…"),
and an authored-dot only earns its place on a *mixed-author* timeline
(realtor actions interleaved with Chippi's), which the current surfaces
don't render. Wire it when such a surface exists. Forcing it onto an
all-Chippi surface makes it decoration on every row — exactly the
scarcity failure the brand-orange rule guards against.

`ChippiWordmarkInline` earned its first consumer on the day-one
`FocusCard` welcome ("I'm Chippi. I track your deals…"). That's the
realtor's first emotional moment with the agent; naming the brand once,
in serif Times orange, anchors every first-person "I" that follows.
Don't add a second instance to that surface — scarcity is the whole
point. New surfaces are welcome to use it once, where the brand
genuinely belongs.

---

## Onboarding storytelling (`components/onboarding/onboarding-realtor-v2.tsx`)

Onboarding is a **story**, not a wizard. The wizard collects fields then
summarizes them. The story has an emotional arc: welcome → recognition →
trust → a payoff where the product *does something for you before you
arrive*. This is the Apple onboarding move, and it's the one place we
spend motion freely — because the realtor's first impression is the
whole game.

### The arc

Nine stages, **one idea each**. Never put two ideas on one onboarding
screen — that's the wizard smell.

```
1. welcome   — "Hi. I'm Chippi." + the one promise. (the cover, no dots)
2. name      — name + role. Role auto-advances when the name's filled.
3. business  — business name → live slug check.
4. where     — ZIP + tenure. Creates the workspace.
5. promise   — the trust micro-screen.
6. serve     — audience + voice guidance.
7. voice     — pick warm vs direct from two real drafts.
8. sources   — top 1-2 lead sources.
9. reveal    — Chippi TYPES a first-touch draft, live. (the payoff, no dots)
```

### The three patterns that make it a story

1. **The trust promise** (`StagePromise`). A breath between setup and
   the profile questions. Names the single most common new-user fear —
   *"will it send things without me?"* — once, plainly, in serif:
   *"I draft. You approve. Nothing leaves without your name on it."*
   A 1.4s minimum-display gate keeps the realtor from tapping past
   before reading. Then it's never mentioned again. **Don't turn this
   into a settings toggle** — it's a promise, not a preference.

2. **The typing reveal** (`StageReveal` + `TypingText`). The payoff.
   Chippi types out a real first-touch message in the realtor's chosen
   voice, naming their business, tuned to their primary lead source.
   The "take me in" button fades in only once typing finishes — the
   realtor *watches Chippi work*, then walks in. The draft is
   **deterministic** (`lib/onboarding-draft.ts`), never an LLM call:
   onboarding is the one screen we cannot let a model misfire on, and
   the magic is the live typing, not the generation.

3. **Bookend stages hide progress dots** (`hideProgress` on
   `OnboardingShell`). The welcome cover and the reveal payoff aren't
   "step 1 of 9" and "step 8 of 9" — a book cover isn't a page, and the
   payoff shouldn't read as a chore three-quarters done. Dots track only
   the seven middle "doing work" stages.

### Rollback discipline

V2 is the **live onboarding** — what every new realtor sees. Two escape
hatches stay wired for safety:

- **`?legacy=1`** on `/setup` — per-request rollback for a single realtor
  (support can hand this URL to a user who hits trouble).
- **`NEXT_PUBLIC_ONBOARDING_V2=false`** — deploy-level kill switch. Flip
  this on Vercel and redeploy to revert every signup to V1 without a
  code change.

The legacy `onboarding-realtor.tsx` stays as that rollback path until V2
has run in prod for a week without incident. Then a single cleanup PR
deletes V1, the gate, and the `onboarding-realtor-shared.tsx` consumer
in V2. Until that PR lands: **don't refactor the legacy flow** — it's
scheduled for removal; editing code you're about to delete is risk with
no payoff.

### The `TypingText` component

`components/onboarding/typing-text.tsx`. Reusable typewriter. Honors
`prefers-reduced-motion` (renders instantly, fires `onDone` immediately —
no dead air for someone who asked for stillness). The caret is
foreground, **not** orange — the brand signature belongs to the content,
not the cursor. Also used by the Phase 4 morning-story reveal.

## Iconography

| Library | `lucide-react` |
|---|---|
| Default size | 14–16 in primary actions, 11–13 in chrome / muted UI |
| Pairing | `inline-flex gap-1.5` for icon+text in chips, `gap-2` in buttons |
| Stroke weight | Default lucide |

Common pairings (memorise the verb-icon shape so the agent surface stays
coherent):

```
CalendarCheck   booked / confirmed
ArrowUpRight    advanced / moved forward
ArrowRightLeft  routed
Flag            flagged / review
Paperclip       attached (packet, doc)
MessageSquare   SMS / draft
Mail            email
Bell            follow-up scheduled
Brain           memory / observation
MessageCircle   Chippi (the agent itself)
```

---

## File map — where the truth lives

```
app/globals.css                  Theme tokens, CSS variables, Clerk overrides
lib/typography.ts                Type scale, spacing rhythm, primary pill, ghost pill
lib/motion.ts                    Eases, durations, stagger + dialog variants
