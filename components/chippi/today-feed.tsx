/**
 * The default surface — focus mode. One focal item at a time. The realtor
 * lands on /chippi and sees ONE thing waiting on them with Send / Edit /
 * Hold for later. When that's done, the next one slides in. When the queue
 * clears, a calm acknowledgement.
 *
 * "Show full day →" expands into the dispatch console (Drafts I made /
 * Questions I have / Who to reach today / What's coming / What I did)
 * for power users who want the dashboard view. The toggle is local state;
 * focus mode is the default every time.
 *
 * The realtor signal said simplicity wins. This is more simplicity — five
 * sections to one card. The dashboard view stays one tap away, but the
 * default is the assistant, not the dashboard.
