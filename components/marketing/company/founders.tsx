 * Founders — the two-up section. Orlando and Preston, each a square headshot
 * placeholder (owner swaps real media in), a name, a one-line role, and a
 * short bio. Built from the home kit's vocabulary (Stagger + Placeholder) so
 * it reads as the same family as the rest of the marketing site. No fabricated
 * photo files — the Placeholder is the deliberate "headshot goes here" slot.
