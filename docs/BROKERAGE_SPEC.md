A broker owner signs up; creates their Brokerage; invites realtors; each
realtor gets a workspace ("Space") linked back to the brokerage. Leads route
in via public application forms or manual broker-side entry and land in the
right agent's workspace. Deals close, commissions land in a persistent
ledger. The broker gets visibility across every agent without stepping into
their individual Space.

_Chunks covering the feature map (BP1–BP7 + the three linear step features),
the route inventory, audit logging, and known gaps are appended by
subsequent writers in separate commits. Search the file for `# Feature map`,
`# Route inventory`, etc._

## 1. Concepts

- **Brokerage** — top-level organisation. Owned by a single `User` via
  `Brokerage.ownerId` (FK `ON DELETE RESTRICT`, supabase/schema.sql:34). Has
  a `status` of `active | suspended` (schema.sql:35) and an optional unique
  `joinCode` (schema.sql:38).
- **BrokerageMembership** — user ↔ brokerage join row carrying a `role`
  (schema.sql:239). Unique `(brokerageId, userId)` so a given user holds at
  most one role per brokerage (schema.sql:246).
- **Space** — the per-agent workspace. Linked back to a brokerage via the
  nullable `Space.brokerageId` column (schema.sql:54), `ON DELETE SET NULL`
  so un-brokering never cascades.
- **Invitation** — token-based invite row with a 7-day default TTL
  (schema.sql:257). Status CHECK enum is
  `pending | accepted | expired | cancelled` (schema.sql:255-256).
- **Public entry paths**:
  - `/apply/b/[brokerageId]` — inbound lead application form.
  - `/s/[slug]` — a realtor's workspace (agent-facing).
  - `/broker/*` — broker-owner/admin control surface.

## 2. Permission model

Three nested helpers, each building on `requireAuth`'s offboarding gate
(`User.status !== 'offboarded'` at lib/api-auth.ts:30-56).

| Helper | Returns | Roles allowed | When to use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `requireAuth` | `{ userId }` or `NextResponse` (401/403) | Any signed-in, non-offboarded user | Default API auth |
| `getBrokerContext` | `{brokerage, membership, dbUserId}` or `null` | `broker_owner`, `broker_admin` | Server components; page-level gates |
| `requireBroker` | same, throws on null | same | API routes that 403 on missing broker ctx |
| `getBrokerMemberContext` | same | `broker_owner`, `broker_admin`, `realtor_member` | Pages/routes that should be visible to any brokerage member |

**Offboarding hard-stop.** Every broker helper re-checks `User.status` after
Clerk auth and returns `null` if the user has been offboarded (hardening
applied in Phase BP3 audit follow-up, commit 6d05915; see
lib/permissions.ts:72-79 and :131-132). Server-side pages under
`/app/s/[slug]/reviews/*` also re-check this locally (Linear Step 1 audit
follow-up, 4e3fc5e) because they use `auth()` directly instead of going
through `requireAuth`.

**Dual-auth pattern.** `POST /api/broker/reviews/[id]/comments` accepts
EITHER a broker member OR the requesting agent (`review.requestingUserId
=== dbUser.id`). That's the path that lets the realtor post comments on
their own flagged-for-review deal.

**Role enum** (lib/permissions.ts, via CHECK at schema.sql:243):
`broker_owner`, `broker_admin`, `realtor_member`. The
`Invitation.roleToAssign` column only accepts `broker_admin | realtor_member`
(CHECK constraint, schema.sql:253; a new owner is minted by the
create-brokerage path, not by an invitation).

## 3. Data model

One compact paragraph per table. Cite the migration or schema.sql line
where the table is defined. **Do not dump every column** — name the
important ones and the constraints that matter for correctness, and link
out.

### Brokerage
The top-level org. Base columns come from
`supabase/migrations/20260314000003_org_system.sql` and are mirrored in
supabase/schema.sql:31-45: `name`, `ownerId` with `ON DELETE RESTRICT`,
`status` enum `active|suspended`, optional `logoUrl`/`websiteUrl`,
`joinCode` (UNIQUE). Billing + routing + commissions add:
- `plan` (`starter|team|enterprise`), `seatLimit`
- `stripeCustomerId`, `stripeSubscriptionId`, `stripeSubscriptionStatus`,
  `stripePeriodEnd`
- `autoAssignEnabled`, `assignmentMethod` (`manual|round_robin|score_based`),
  `lastAssignedUserId` (round-robin cursor)
- `defaultAgentRate`, `defaultBrokerRate` (commission defaults snapshotted
  onto ledger rows at close time)

Added across migrations `20260507000000_commission_ledger.sql` (rate
defaults), `20260509000000_brokerage_billing.sql`
(plan/seatLimit/stripe*), and `20260513000000_brokerage_routing.sql`
(autoAssign/method/cursor). See the feature-map chunk for which phase
added which column.

### BrokerageMembership
User ↔ Brokerage join with a `role` enum (schema.sql:239-247). Unique on
`(brokerageId, userId)` so a user can only join a given brokerage once
(schema.sql:246).

### Invitation
Token-based invite (see columns + indexes in
`supabase/migrations/20260314000003_org_system.sql`; mirrored at
schema.sql:249-260). Token is 64-char hex via
`encode(gen_random_bytes(32), 'hex')` (schema.sql:254); 7-day default
`expiresAt` (schema.sql:257). Status enum:
`pending | accepted | expired | cancelled` (schema.sql:255-256).

### Space
The per-agent workspace. Gains a nullable `brokerageId` column (same
migration; schema.sql:54) linking it back to the brokerage; `ON DELETE SET
NULL` so un-brokering a Space doesn't cascade-delete the agent's data.

### Contact
Gains a nullable `brokerageId` column in
`supabase/migrations/20260402000001_contact_brokerage_id.sql` (mirrored
at schema.sql:134) — distinguishes brokerage-owned leads (routed,
reportable) from an agent's personal contacts. FK is
`ON DELETE SET NULL`.

### CommissionLedger
One row per `won` Deal. Sync trigger on Deal (migration
`supabase/migrations/20260507000000_commission_ledger.sql`). Rates are
snapshotted at close — `defaultAgentRate` / `defaultBrokerRate` from the
Brokerage at the moment of close. Status CHECK enum:
`pending | paid | void` (migration line 71). `UNIQUE (dealId)` +
`ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` makes the won-trigger idempotent across
status bounces. Rate-sum cap (≤ 100%) and referral invariant
(non-zero `referralRate` ⇒ non-null `referralUserId`) are enforced at
the API layer, not the schema.

### DealReviewRequest + DealReviewComment
Broker sign-off queue on a specific deal. Migration
`supabase/migrations/20260510000000_deal_review_requests.sql`. Partial
unique index `idx_dealreview_open_per_deal ON "DealReviewRequest"("dealId")
WHERE status = 'open'` (migration lines 92-93) enforces one active
review per deal — API callers must translate a 23505 unique-violation
into a 409. Status CHECK enum: `open | approved | closed` (migration
lines 26-27). `DealReviewComment` references `DealReviewRequest.id`
via `reviewRequestId` with `ON DELETE CASCADE`.

### BrokerageTemplate + MessageTemplate.sourceTemplateId / sourceVersion
Versioned playbook library. Migration
`supabase/migrations/20260511000000_brokerage_templates.sql` replaces a
legacy "magic Note" JSON hack (a Note row with
`title = '[BROKER_TEMPLATES]'` in the broker_owner's personal Space).
That migration also adds two provenance columns to MessageTemplate
(per-agent copies): `sourceTemplateId` (FK to `BrokerageTemplate`,
`ON DELETE SET NULL`) and `sourceVersion` (integer, nullable). The
publish flow uses `sourceVersion IS NULL` as the signal that the agent
edited the copy locally and skips those rows on re-publish. Migration
`20260512000000_template_published_version.sql` adds `publishedVersion`
on BrokerageTemplate so the UI can compare `version === publishedVersion`
directly (replaces a flaky `updatedAt` vs `publishedAt` 1-second-slack
heuristic).

### DealRoutingRule
Optional rules-first routing layer. Migration
`supabase/migrations/20260514000000_deal_routing_rules.sql` + hardening
in `supabase/migrations/20260515000000_routing_rules_hardening.sql`.
Criteria fields (`leadType`, `minBudget`, `maxBudget`, `matchTag`) are
all nullable and AND-combined. Destination is XOR-enforced via CHECK
`deal_routing_rule_destination_xor`:
`("destinationUserId" IS NOT NULL AND "destinationPoolMethod" IS NULL) OR ("destinationUserId" IS NULL AND "destinationPoolMethod" IS NOT NULL)`
(migration lines 72-76). A second CHECK
`deal_routing_rule_budget_range` requires `maxBudget >= minBudget` when
both are set. Hardening flipped `destinationUserId` FK from
`ON DELETE SET NULL` to `ON DELETE CASCADE` because the SET NULL +
XOR combination would make a user hard-delete roll back on the CHECK
(20260515 header).

### AuditLog
Single immutable audit table (supabase/schema.sql:284-294). Columns: `id`,
`clerkId` (nullable for system events), `ipAddress`, `action`, `resource`,
`resourceId`, `spaceId` (nullable for brokerage-wide events), `metadata`
(jsonb — MUST include `brokerageId` for null-spaceId events, per the
Linear Step 2 scoping rule), `createdAt`. The `AuditAction` union in
lib/audit.ts:25-36 currently enumerates `CREATE | UPDATE | DELETE |
ACCESS | LOGIN | LOGOUT | ADMIN_ACTION | OFFBOARD`.

## 4. Feature map

Each phase below links to the canonical source. Descriptions name the
key invariant the code protects — that's what you'll break if you
refactor without reading.

### BP1 — Agent offboarding
The `offboard_brokerage_member(p_leaving_user_id, p_destination_user_id,
p_brokerage_id, p_dry_run)` RPC in
`supabase/migrations/20260506000000_brokerage_offboarding.sql` moves
every brokerage-scoped row owned by the leaving member to the
destination member's Space in a single SECURITY DEFINER transaction —
`Contact` (filtered by `brokerageId` + source `spaceId`), the matching
`ContactActivity`, the `Deal` rows linked to those contacts via
`DealContact`, their `DealActivity` + `DealChecklistItem`, and `Tour`
rows scoped to the moved contacts. The hardening migration
`20260508000000_offboarding_hardening.sql` revoked `authenticated`'s
EXECUTE grant (service_role only now), added a destination-`status =
'active'` check inside the function, and — most importantly — made the
`User.status = 'offboarded'` flip conditional: it only fires when this
was the LAST `BrokerageMembership` row. Dual-brokerage realtors leaving
one firm keep their account active (20260508 lines 156-176); only
`offboardedAt` / `offboardedToUserId` are recorded. API:
`POST /api/broker/members/[id]/offboard`. UI:
`components/broker/offboard-member-dialog.tsx`.

### BP2 — Commission ledger
Persistent ledger driven by `sync_commission_ledger()` triggers on
`Deal` (AFTER INSERT and AFTER UPDATE OF status, both gated by
`NEW.status = 'won'` — see `20260507000000_commission_ledger.sql`
lines 181-192). Rates are snapshotted at close time —
`defaultAgentRate` / `defaultBrokerRate` from the Brokerage row at that
moment — so future rate edits never mutate historical ledger amounts
(migration header, "Snapshot semantics"). `UNIQUE (dealId)` +
`ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` makes status bounces (won→active→won)
idempotent — re-entering `won` is a no-op after the first transition.
`PATCH /api/broker/commissions/ledger/[id]` validates the rate-sum cap
and rejects a non-zero `referralRate` with a null `referralUserId`
(schema-wise these are unconstrained; enforcement lives at the API).
`GET /api/broker/commissions/export` returns CSV, gated to
`broker_owner` / `broker_admin`. UI:
`app/broker/commissions/commissions-client.tsx`. The month picker
operates in UTC to line up with the export's UTC day boundary.

### BP3 — Seat-based billing
Plan tiers `starter | team | enterprise` (schema CHECK, migration
`20260509000000_brokerage_billing.sql` lines 23-24). `lib/brokerage-seats.ts`
computes `used = members + pending-non-expired invites`
(`countPendingInvites` at line 105 filters `status = 'pending'` AND
`expiresAt > now()`). Critical invariant: `checkSeatCapacity`
FAIL-CLOSES on infra error — if either count sub-query returns null,
the function refuses the invite rather than silently leaking past the
cap (lines 174-185). The `loadPlan` fallback is ALSO fail-closed — a
pre-migration / missing column defaults to `starter / 5`, never
unlimited (lines 37-38, 49-82). Invite endpoints return HTTP 402
`{ code: 'seat_limit' }` when capacity is exhausted. Stripe integration
routes the `scope=brokerage` checkout branch to the Brokerage row, and
every webhook handler that writes back goes through
`verifyBrokerageOwnsSubscription` to prevent metadata-poisoning (an
attacker setting `metadata.brokerageId` to a victim org on their own
sub). UI: `components/broker/seat-usage-pill.tsx` +
`/broker/settings/auto-assignment`.

### BP4 — Deal-at-risk dashboard
Reuses `lib/deals/health.ts` at brokerage scope — no new tables, no new
migration. `app/broker/pipeline/page.tsx` computes `atRiskCount +
stuckCount` and a per-agent rollup. `HealthDot` uses colour AND shape
so the dashboard reads in monochrome. The "All pipelines healthy"
reassurance card only renders when both counts are zero AND there are
active deals — an empty brokerage should NOT falsely claim health.

### BP5 — Deal review requests
`DealReviewRequest` + `DealReviewComment` from migration
`20260510000000_deal_review_requests.sql`. Partial unique index
`CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ... idx_dealreview_open_per_deal ON
"DealReviewRequest"("dealId") WHERE status = 'open'` (migration lines
92-93) enforces one open review per deal — the API layer must turn the
resulting 23505 into a 409 Conflict. Status CHECK enum:
`open | approved | closed` (migration lines 26-27). The comments route
`POST /api/broker/reviews/[id]/comments` is the DUAL-AUTH endpoint
documented in §2 — broker member OR the requesting agent
(`review.requestingUserId === dbUser.id`). Resolution via
`PATCH /api/broker/reviews/[id]` sets `resolvedAt` +
`resolvedByUserId` + `status` and is gated to `broker_owner` /
`broker_admin`. Agent-side surface at `/s/[slug]/reviews` is the
Linear Step 1 deliverable.

### BP6 — Playbook template versioning
`BrokerageTemplate` (migration
`20260511000000_brokerage_templates.sql`) replaces the legacy
`title = '[BROKER_TEMPLATES]'` magic-Note JSON blob; the legacy Note
rows are left in place as a rollback window per the migration header.
The same migration adds `sourceTemplateId` + `sourceVersion` to
`MessageTemplate` (lines 49-53). Publish semantics: on re-publish, the
route detects "agent locally edited" via `sourceVersion IS NULL` and
SKIPS such rows (that's the explicit contract from the migration
comment at lines 46-48). Migration
`20260512000000_template_published_version.sql` adds
`publishedVersion` so the UI compares `version === publishedVersion`
for up-to-date vs amber (replacing the old 1-second-slack
`updatedAt` vs `publishedAt` heuristic described in that migration's
header). Publish fan-out scopes its Space lookup to
`brokerageId = caller.brokerageId` — the same cross-tenant guard
spirit as the BP3 metadata-poisoning fix.

### BP7 — Lead routing
Two layers in `lib/brokerage-routing.ts`. Rules layer:
`loadEnabledRules` (line 154) loads `DealRoutingRule` rows
`WHERE brokerageId = ? AND enabled = true ORDER BY priority ASC,
createdAt ASC`; `ruleMatches` (line 186) AND-combines criteria
case-insensitively and REJECTS a budget-bounded rule against a
null-budget lead (lines 192-200) — null-budget leads fall through to
the next rule. Destination is XOR-enforced via CHECK
`deal_routing_rule_destination_xor`:
`("destinationUserId" IS NOT NULL AND "destinationPoolMethod" IS NULL)
OR ("destinationUserId" IS NULL AND "destinationPoolMethod" IS NOT NULL)`
(migration `20260514000000_deal_routing_rules.sql` lines 72-76). Pool
method with a `destinationPoolTag` is accepted by the schema and API
but IGNORED by the v1 engine — `resolveRuleDestination` only logs and
continues (lib/brokerage-routing.ts lines 446-452), because
`BrokerageMembership` has no tags column yet (migration header lines
58-63). Don't let the UI promise tag-narrowing. Fallback layer:
`round_robin` honours `Brokerage.lastAssignedUserId` cursor
(`pickNextAfterCursor` line 313 wraps index 0 when the cursor is null
or stale); `score_based` picks the agent with the fewest active
pipeline Contacts (`type IN ('QUALIFICATION','TOUR','APPLICATION')`
and not currently snoozed — lines 358-385), ties broken by the same
cursor. Callers: `/api/brokerages/leads`, `/api/public/apply/brokerage`,
and the CRUD routes under `/api/broker/routing-rules[+/[id]]`. UI:
`app/broker/settings/routing-rules/rules-client.tsx`. Hardening
migration `20260515000000_routing_rules_hardening.sql` enabled RLS
with no policies AND flipped `destinationUserId` FK from
`ON DELETE SET NULL` to `ON DELETE CASCADE` — under SET NULL a user
hard-delete would null out `destinationUserId`, trip the XOR CHECK,
and roll back the entire DELETE (header lines 13-22).

### Linear Step 1 — Realtor-side reviews
Agent-facing surface at `app/s/[slug]/reviews/*.tsx` (list + detail +
composer). GETs at `/api/space/[slug]/reviews` and
`/api/space/[slug]/reviews/[id]`. These pages re-check the
offboarding gate LOCALLY because server components use `auth()`
directly, not `requireAuth` — the same follow-up documented in §2's
offboarding hard-stop note (commit 4e3fc5e). Comment posting reuses
the broker route `POST /api/broker/reviews/[id]/comments` via the
dual-auth path — there is no duplicate comment endpoint on the space
side.

### Linear Step 2 — Brokerage activity log
`app/broker/activity` surfaces `AuditLog` rows scoped to the
brokerage. The scope is the UNION of two predicates:
`(AuditLog.spaceId IN brokerage.spaceIds)` OR
`(AuditLog.spaceId IS NULL AND metadata->>'brokerageId' =
caller.brokerageId)` — the null-spaceId branch is why the data-model
section documents `metadata.brokerageId` as REQUIRED for
brokerage-wide events. Pagination cursor is a compound
`<createdAt>|<id>` tuple — a bare ISO cursor missed rows on
millisecond ties until the hardening commit tupled it. The older
aggregator at `/api/broker/activity` (new leads / deals / tours
feed) was preserved under `/api/broker/team-activity`; its sole
consumer `components/broker/team-activity-feed.tsx` was repointed.

### Linear Step 3 — Lead routing rules v2
This is the `DealRoutingRule` + rule layer already described in BP7.
CRUD routes under `/api/broker/routing-rules` +
`/api/broker/routing-rules/[id]`; UI under
`app/broker/settings/routing-rules`.
