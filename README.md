# Chippi

Real estate CRM and lead management platform for realtors and brokerages.

---

## What is Chippi?

Chippi is a SaaS platform that helps realtors capture, qualify, and manage rental leads through a streamlined workflow. It combines a public-facing intake form, AI-powered lead scoring, a full CRM pipeline, tour scheduling, and brokerage team management into a single product.

### Key features

- **Public intake forms** — Custom-branded application pages for prospects to submit rental applications
- **AI lead scoring** — Automatic lead qualification using GPT-4o-mini with score, tier (hot/warm/cold), and actionable summaries
- **CRM pipeline** — Kanban-style deal management with customizable stages, drag-and-drop, and contact linking
- **Tour scheduling** — Public booking page, calendar integration, automated confirmations/reminders
- **Brokerage management** — Multi-user team dashboards, invite system, performance tracking across realtors
- **AI assistant** — On-demand agent with a tool-use loop over the realtor's CRM (read-only tools auto-run; mutating tools — email, SMS, deal/stage changes, tours — require per-call user approval). Delegates research questions to read-only sub-agents so profile lookups don't bloat the orchestrator's context. See `lib/ai-tools/tools/index.ts` for the tool registry and `lib/ai-tools/skills/*` for the sub-agents.
- **Brokerage tier** — Multi-agent organisation with per-seat billing: brokerage membership + role tiers (`broker_owner`, `broker_admin`, `realtor_member`) in `lib/permissions.ts`; lead routing across agents (`lib/brokerage-routing.ts`); commission ledger (`lib/commissions.ts`); Stripe-backed seat subscriptions (`lib/brokerage-seats.ts`, `app/api/billing/*`)
- **Notifications** — Email (Resend) and SMS (Telnyx) notifications for leads, tours, deals, and follow-ups
- **Analytics** — Weekly trends, conversion funnels, and team performance metrics

### Who it's for

- **Solo realtors** handling leasing and rental leads
- **Small teams** and brokerages managing multiple realtors
- **Broker-only users** overseeing team performance without a personal workspace

## Core workflows

1. **Realtor signs up** via Clerk and completes onboarding (or skips to set up later)
2. **Workspace created** with a custom slug and public intake link
3. **Prospects submit** rental applications through the public intake form
4. **Leads are scored** automatically by AI and saved as contacts
5. **Realtor manages** leads, contacts, deals, and tours from the workspace dashboard
6. **Notifications sent** via email and/or SMS based on workspace preferences
7. **Brokers** can invite realtors, track team performance, and manage the brokerage
