# Chippi

Agentic operating system for realtors and brokerages.

---

## What is Chippi?

Chippi is an agentic operating system for realtors and brokerages. It combines always-on AI agent workflows, lead intake, qualification, follow-up orchestration, and brokerage coordination into a single operational platform.

### Key features

- **Public intake forms** — Custom-branded application pages for prospects to submit rental applications
- **AI lead scoring** — Automatic lead qualification using GPT-4o-mini with score, tier (hot/warm/cold), and actionable summaries
- **CRM pipeline** — Kanban-style deal management with customizable stages, drag-and-drop, and contact linking
- **Tour scheduling** — Public booking page, calendar integration, automated confirmations/reminders
- **Brokerage management** — Multi-user team dashboards, invite system, performance tracking across realtors
- **AI agent** — Agent runtime with tool-use over the realtor operating system (read-only tools auto-run; mutating tools — email, SMS, deal/stage changes, tours — require per-call user approval). Delegates research questions to read-only sub-agents so profile lookups don't bloat the orchestrator's context. See `lib/ai-tools/tools/index.ts` for the tool registry and `lib/ai-tools/skills/*` for the sub-agents.
- **Always-on background activation** — Incoming CRM events are queued in Redis and immediately attempt a Modal webhook fire (`POST /api/agent/trigger`) so per-realtor agents can react in near real-time with queue-based fallback if Modal is unavailable. Immediate fire policy is configurable with `AGENT_IMMEDIATE_EVENTS` (`all` by default, or comma-separated event names; invalid values fail safe to `all`).
- **Trigger operations runbook** — Operational endpoints, env vars, alerting, and replay workflow are documented in `docs/AGENT_TRIGGER_OPERATIONS.md`.
- **Brokerage tier** — Multi-agent organisation with per-seat billing: brokerage membership + role tiers (`broker_owner`, `broker_admin`, `realtor_member`) in `lib/permissions.ts`; lead routing across agents (`lib/brokerage-routing.ts`); commission ledger (`lib/commissions.ts`); Stripe-backed seat subscriptions (`lib/brokerage-seats.ts`, `app/api/billing/*`)
- **Notifications** — Email (Resend) and SMS (Telnyx) notifications for leads, tours, deals, and follow-ups
- **Analytics** — Weekly trends, conversion funnels, and team performance metrics

### Who it's for

- **Solo realtors** handling leasing and rental leads
- **Small teams** and brokerages managing multiple realtors
- **Broker-only users** overseeing team performance without a personal workspace

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Required variables:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` + `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` — Supabase connection
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` + `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` — Clerk auth
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` — Lead scoring and embeddings

Optional:
- `RESEND_API_KEY` + `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` — Email notifications

See [ENVIRONMENT.md](./ENVIRONMENT.md) for the full reference.

### Install and run

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

### Database setup

### Build for production

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

## Core workflows

1. **Realtor signs up** via Clerk and completes onboarding (or skips to set up later)
2. **Workspace created** with a custom slug and public intake link
3. **Prospects submit** rental applications through the public intake form
4. **Leads are scored** automatically by AI and saved as contacts
5. **Realtor manages** leads, contacts, deals, and tours from the workspace dashboard
6. **Notifications sent** via email and/or SMS based on workspace preferences
7. **Brokers** can invite realtors, track team performance, and manage the brokerage

- Design tokens (colors, spacing, typography, motion)
- Component specs (cards, tables, forms, modals, etc.)
- Screen archetypes (dashboard, analytics, table index, detail, settings)
- Dashboard archetypes (queue, pipeline, analytics, admin overview)
- Responsive breakpoints and mobile behavior
