/**
 * LLM provider — OpenRouter.
 *
 * # The provider boundary (read this before adding a model call)
 *
 * There is ONE rule, and it keeps OpenAI-API and OpenRouter cleanly separate:
 *
 *   - **All text/LLM work** — chat agent, autonomous runs, embeddings, lead
 *     scoring, scoring-model generation, form optimization, compaction,
 *     summaries — goes through `getLLMClient()` here. That client points at
 *     OpenRouter whenever `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is set (the configured default)
 *     and only falls back to the OpenAI API (`OPENAI_API_KEY`) when OpenRouter
 *     is absent. Model slugs for this path MUST be provider-correct: use
 *     `openaiModel(name)` / `resolveChatModel()` so a bare `gpt-*` slug becomes
 *     `openai/gpt-*` on OpenRouter. NEVER `new OpenAI(...)` directly for LLM
 *     work — that bypasses OpenRouter and breaks OpenRouter-only deploys.
 *
 *   - **Audio only** — Whisper transcription and TTS — talk to the OpenAI API
 *     directly (`process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY`), because OpenRouter does not
 *     expose those endpoints. Those routes (`app/api/ai/transcribe|speak`, the
 *     Telnyx voice webhook) are the ONLY sanctioned direct-OpenAI callers. If
 *     you find a direct OpenAI client anywhere else doing text completion, it's
 *     a bug.
 *
 * OpenRouter is OpenAI-API-compatible, so the only difference from calling
 * OpenAI directly is the base URL + key.
 *
 * The Python agent has its own equivalent at `agent/llm.py`. The chat
 * model registry lives in `./chat-models` (pure data, client-safe) and is
 * re-exported here for server-side convenience.

 * OpenRouter upstream could hold a serverless function open for minutes and
 * triple the token spend on every slow call. We cap both:
 *   - timeout 120s: generous enough that a single (streamed) chat completion
 *     finishes well within it, but bounded so a hang can't outlive the function.
 *     A caller with a genuinely longer call can override per-request
 *     (`client.chat.completions.create(..., { timeout })`).
