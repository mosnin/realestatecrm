/**
 * LLM provider — OpenRouter.
 *
 * Every model call in the app (chat agent, autonomous runs, embeddings,
 * lead-scoring enhancement, the legacy RAG route) goes through one OpenAI
 * client built here. OpenRouter is OpenAI-API-compatible, so the only
 * difference from calling OpenAI directly is the base URL + key.
 *
 * Fallback: when `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is absent the client falls back to
 * calling OpenAI directly with `OPENAI_API_KEY`, so a deploy that hasn't
 * set the OpenRouter key keeps working.
 *
 * The Python agent has its own equivalent at `agent/llm.py`. The chat
 * model registry lives in `./chat-models` (pure data, client-safe) and is
 * re-exported here for server-side convenience.
