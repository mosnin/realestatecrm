/**
 * Account deletion — the destructive sweep, in one reviewed place.
 *
 * GDPR right to erasure / CCPA right to delete (Privacy Policy §11.1). This is
 * the only place in the codebase that hard-deletes a user's full footprint, so
 * it lives behind a single function with the table-by-table plan documented in
 * docs/DATA-DELETION.md. Read that doc before touching this.
 *
 * How the cascade works (this is load-bearing):
 *   - `Space.ownerId REFERENCES "User"(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`
 *   - almost every Space-scoped table is `REFERENCES "Space"(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`
 *   So deleting the single User row cascades to the Space row, which cascades
 *   to Contact, Deal, Property, Conversation, Message, Note, Tour, etc. We do
 *   not hand-roll a deletion order — Postgres enforces it via the FK graph.
 *
 * What does NOT cascade (and so is swept explicitly here, BEFORE the User
 * delete, while we still hold the spaceId):
 *   - `Attachment`     — has spaceId but no FK to Space
 *   - `TelemetryEvent` — has nullable spaceId, no FK to Space
 *   - Wasabi storage objects — Postgres can't cascade into object storage, so
 *     we enumerate the keys and best-effort delete the blobs before the row
 *     cascade fires (see deleteSpaceStorageObjects).
 *
 * What is intentionally retained (see docs/DATA-DELETION.md §retention):
 *   - Stripe customer/invoice records (held by Stripe; legal/financial retention)
 *   - CommissionLedger (brokerage-owned financial record, not space-owned)
 *   - SupportTicket / Property pool rows that ON DELETE SET NULL rather than cascade
 *
 * The feature flag (ACCOUNT_DELETION_HARD_DELETE) gates the irreversible DB
 * sweep. With it off, the route still deletes the Clerk user and records the
 * request, but leaves the workspace rows intact for the documented manual /
 * reviewed run. This is deliberate: we do not ship an untested cascade as
 * always-on. Flip it once owner has signed off on docs/DATA-DELETION.md.

/**
 * Collect every Wasabi object key owned by a space, across the four tables that
 * carry a storage reference, and best-effort delete the underlying blobs.
 *
 * GDPR erasure means the bytes, not just the DB rows. The cascade deletes the
 * rows (File/DealDocument/ContactDocument via Space FK; Attachment is swept
 * explicitly), but Postgres knows nothing about Wasabi — without this the
 * objects survive forever. So we enumerate the keys WHILE the rows still exist
 * (before the cascade fires) and drop the blobs.
 *
 * Best-effort by design: a Wasabi failure here must never abort the DB
 * deletion (the user's right to erasure of their data outranks orphan-cleanup),
 * and the nightly storage-gc cron sweeps anything we miss. We log failures.
 *
 * Storage columns per table (verified against the migrations):
 *   - Attachment.storagePath        (chat-attachments/…)
 *   - File.storageKey               (files/… and studio/… — studio media is File rows)
 *   - DealDocument.storagePath      (deal-documents/…)
 *   - ContactDocument.storageKey    (contact-documents/…)
