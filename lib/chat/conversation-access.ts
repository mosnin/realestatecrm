/**
 * Realtor / broker conversation isolation boundary.
 *
 * Broker-Chippi and brokerage team chats live in the SAME `Conversation`
 * table as realtor conversations today, keyed by `spaceId` and distinguished
 * only by a reserved title prefix. A broker_owner also owns their personal
 * realtor space, so space ownership ALONE is not isolation — the realtor
 * surface must additionally refuse any conversation whose title carries a
 * reserved prefix.
 *
 * This module is the single source of truth for that boundary. Keep it
 * dependency-free (no supabase, no clerk) so the predicates are trivially
 * unit-testable and so every realtor read path routes through the same
 * checks. If this class of leak is to fail CI, it has to live in one place.
 *
 * No em dashes below this point are in code — the prose above is comment.
