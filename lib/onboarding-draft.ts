/**
 * The first-touch draft Chippi "writes" during the onboarding reveal.
 *
 * This is the payoff of the welcome promise ("by the end, I'll already
 * be working on it"). At the final onboarding stage Chippi types out a
 * real first-touch message — in the realtor's chosen voice, naming
 * their business, tuned to their primary lead source — so the realtor
 * SEES the agent work before the dashboard ever loads.
 *
 * Why deterministic, not an LLM call. Onboarding is the single
 * highest-stakes first impression in the product. An LLM call here is
 * slow (seconds of dead air), costs money on every signup, and — worst
 * — can misfire on the one screen we cannot afford to get wrong. A
 * template keyed off the realtor's own inputs is instant, free, and
 * cannot produce a bad sentence. The MAGIC is the live typing
 * animation, not the generation. Keep it here, pure and tested.
 *
 * Everything in this file is a pure function of its inputs — no I/O,
 * no Date.now(), no randomness. That's what makes it unit-testable and
 * what makes the reveal identical every time the realtor sees it.
