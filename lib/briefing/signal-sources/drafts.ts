/**
 * Drafts signal source — surfaces pending AgentDraft rows the autonomous
 * agent has produced (from Gmail triggers, routine runs, calendar event
 * handlers, etc.).
 *
 * Why this is in Phase B and not Phase A: AgentDraft is the OUTPUT of
 * the agent's autonomous work. Surfacing drafts in the brief gives the
 * realtor "what Chippi did overnight, ready for your approve" — the
 * single highest-value card type for a working realtor whose agent
 * actually ran.
 *
 * Why this is its own source (not folded into pipeline/leads): drafts
 * are concrete + actionable — the work is already done, just needs a
 * yes/no — while pipeline/leads signals are abstract ("this deal sat
 * too long"). Different confidence ceilings, different verb.
 *
 * Confidence calibration:
 *   - High-priority draft for hot lead:        0.95
 *   - High-priority draft for any lead tier:   0.90
 *   - Standard draft for hot lead:             0.88
 *   - Standard draft, any tier:                0.83
 *
 * The brief shows the top drafts as REPLY cards; the rest stay in the
 * FocusCard queue on /chippi/today. The two surfaces complement: the
 * brief is the morning curated view, the focus card is the working queue.
