/**
 * Cron dead-man monitoring.
 *
 * The scheduled crons (Inngest-fired — lib/inngest/cron-functions.ts) run
 * unattended. The failure mode that actually hurts is
 * SILENT: a sweep stops firing, or starts returning 500s, and nobody notices
 * until the data is stale and a customer complains. This wrapper closes that
 * gap with the cheapest mechanism that works — Sentry Cron Monitoring
 * (check-ins).
 *
 * For each wrapped handler we:
 *   1. Open an "in_progress" check-in against a per-cron monitor slug, passing
 *      the cron's crontab schedule. Sentry now knows when the job SHOULD run,
 *      so a MISSED run (the job never starts) alerts on its own — no code on
 *      our side can detect "I didn't run", only Sentry's server-side scheduler
 *      can, and this is how we hand it the schedule.
 *   2. Run the real handler.
 *   3. Close the check-in "ok" or "error". We treat BOTH a thrown error AND a
 *      returned 5xx as a failure — most of these handlers catch their own
 *      errors and return `NextResponse.json(..., { status: 500 })` WITHOUT
 *      throwing, so a status-blind wrapper would mark a broken run "ok". That
 *      silent-500 case is the exact thing we're guarding against.
 *   4. On a thrown error, also `captureException` tagged with the cron name so
 *      it lands as a normal Sentry issue (with stack) in addition to the
 *      check-in, then re-throw so the route still surfaces the 500.
 *
 * DSN-gated: with no Sentry DSN the SDK is dormant and every call here is a
 * cheap no-op, so local dev and CI never phone home. Business logic is never
 * touched — the wrapper only observes.
